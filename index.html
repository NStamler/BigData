                <p>According to a 2019 Kiplinger survey, the median cost of homes in NYC is about $652,700, compared with a national median of $245,000. Additionally, in NYC, consumer prices are 24% higher while restaurant prices are 28% higher than in other cities. This means that New York City as a whole is very expensive to live in.</p>

        <div class="col">
                <p>One of the most expensive parts about living in New York City is the housing. According to the 2018 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, 44% of all New York households are rent burdened, meaning that rent constitutes more than 30% of their income (AMI), the standard for rent affordability, after accounting for rental housing vouchers and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. A little over half of these households are severely rent burdened, meaning that rent constitutes more than half of their income.</p>

        <div class="col">
                <p>To put a number to the severely rent burdened, this accounts for 580,000 households in NYC. According to NYC For All: The Housing We Need, a report by NYC comptroller Scott Stringer, about 90% of these households earn less than $47,000/year for a family of three. Only 25% of NYC’s affordable housing program addresses the needs of these New Yorkers.</p>
